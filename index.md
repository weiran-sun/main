### About me

I am a Professor in the Mathematics Department of the Simon Fraser University. My research area is PDE and applied analysis with the main focus on the kinetic theory. Current specific topics that I am interested in include: 
  - Analysis of kinetic equations
  - Inverse problems related to kinetic equations and related ones
  - Numerical analysis of kinetic equations

I also enjoy working with researchers in other areas and provide mathematical tech support. Recently, I become increasingly interested in AI-for-Math and start working with computer scientists (the [DeLTA Lab](https://delta-lab-ai.github.io/index.html) led by Professor Wuyang Chen at SFU) on automating PDE analysis.
